[DaxLib.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DaxLib.Client) is the NuGet package that can be used by external tools to integrate with [DaxLib](https://daxlib.org) directly:
- Create packages
- Download packages

**NOTE**: Currently, the client does not add the functions to the semantic model, the external tool does that (like Tabular Editor). However, this feature will be added soon in the client before the integration with [Bravo for Power BI](https://bravo.bi).
