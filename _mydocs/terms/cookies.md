This document explains the technologies used by the DAX Lib website and services (this “Application”) to achieve the purposes described below. These technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example, by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example, by running a script) on your device while you interact with this Application.

For simplicity, we refer to all these technologies as **"Trackers"** throughout this document—unless there is a need to distinguish them. For instance, although Cookies work on both web and mobile browsers, they are browser-based and do not apply to native mobile apps. Therefore, we use the term *Cookies* only when we specifically mean that type of Tracker.

Depending on applicable law, some purposes for which Trackers are used may require your consent. If you provide consent, you can withdraw it at any time by following the instructions outlined in this document.

**This Application uses only Trackers managed directly by us that are strictly necessary** for the operation or delivery of the service you requested, or that are strictly necessary to provide a service explicitly requested by you. These Trackers do not require your consent.
