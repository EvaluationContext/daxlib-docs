The  `README.md` file with your library will be displayed alongside your library on [daxlib.org](https://daxlib.org/). Its content must follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and to be approved for publication.

- **Use professional language**. No profanity, offensive content, or inappropriate terminology.
- **Be concise and relevant**. Include only information that helps users understand and use your library effectively.
- **Keep the structure simple and organized**. Use clear headings, bullet points, and logical sections for easy reading.
- **External links** are permitted only if they are safe and trustworthy. All links will be verified using Google Safe Browsing (https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search).
- **Do not** include images that **imitate**, replicate, or closely resemble **UI elements** from the DAX Lib website.
- **Use publicly accessible and stable external URLs** for all media assets. Assets URLs must not point to images or assets included within the library package, as this is not supported. **Do not embed** images or assets as **Base64**. 
- Image **aspect ratio must be preserved**. Prefer specifying only the `width` attribute so the height scales automatically.
- **Large images** should be **optimized** to maintain reasonable performance.
- **Do not wrap images in links**. Images must not be clickable or redirect users.
- **Avoid inline CSS or styling** that overrides global styles (if applicable to your system).
- **Do not embed iframe** objects.

You can include in the `README.md` file a link to a sample file to showcase how to use the functions in your library.

If you need a more comprehensive documentation site, consider creating a dedicated documentation website as described in the [Documentation sites](doc-sites.md) section.
