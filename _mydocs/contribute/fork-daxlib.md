For small libraries (a few functions), you can follow these steps to add a new package to DAX Lib.

## **Fork** 

Fork the DAX Lib repository: 

<a href="https://github.com/daxlib/daxlib/fork" class="button" target="_blank">Fork daxlib/daxlib</a>
    
This creates a personal copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

> Do not make changes directly on the `main` branch. Always create a separate branch for each change you want to make. For example, `add-my-package-version-1.0.0`. This keeps your work isolated until it's reviewed and approved.

## Create a folder 

Create a folder for your package in `/packages/`, following the [naming conventions](naming-conventions.md) for both the folder structure and library name. For a library named `Contoso.Conversion` with version `1.0.0`, the folder structure should be `/packages/c/contoso.conversion/1.0.0/`
    
## Create the package

DAX lib expects a `manifest.daxlib` and `lib/functions.tmdl` files. A `README.md` and `icon.png` can be optionally included.

```txt
└── 📁 packages
    |── 📁 a   
    ├── 📁 ...
    ├── 📁 c
    │    └── 📁 contoso.conversion
    │         └── 📁 1.0.0  
    │              ├── 📁 lib
    │              │    └── functions.tmdl   // Required - Your DAX UDF functions 
    │              ├── 📄 icon.png           // Optional - Icon for your library
    │              ├── 📄 README.md          // Optional - Docs for your library
    │              └── 📄 manifest.daxlib    // Required - Declares package properties
    ├── 📁 ...
    └── 📁 z
```

> You can use the [DaxLib.Sample](https://github.com/daxlib/daxlib/tree/main/packages/d/daxlib.sample/0.1.6) package as a starting point: copy it, rename it according to your library’s name, and then update its contents to match your library.

### manifest.daxlib

*Required:* The package properties in JSON format.

``` json
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sql-bi/daxlib/refs/heads/main/schemas/manifest/1.0.0/manifest.1.0.0.schema.json",
    "id": "Contoso.Conversion",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "authors": "contoso",
    "description": "My amazing library",
    "tags": "DAX,UDF",
    "releaseNotes": "🚀",   // optional
    "projectUrl": "https://contoso.github.io/contoso.conversion/", // optional
    "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/sql-bi/daxlib/tree/main/packages/c/contoso.conversion",
    "icon": "/icon.png",    // optional
    "readme": "/README.md"  // optional
}
```

> refer to the [JSON schema](https://github.com/daxlib/daxlib/blob/main/schemas/manifest/1.0.0/manifest.1.0.0.schema.json) for the complete specification of available properties. You can also refer to the example [DaxLib.Sample](https://daxlib.org/package/DaxLib.Sample/#code) package.

### lib/functions.tmdl

*Required:* Contains TMDL definition of the functions within your library.

```dax
/// Convert from Celsius(°C) to Fahrenheit(°F)
/// @param {decimal} temperature – The temperature in Celsius
/// @returns The temperature converted to Fahrenheit
FUNCTION CelsiusToFahrenheit = ( temperature: DOUBLE ) =>
        ( temperature * ( 9 / 5 ) ) + 32

  annotation DAXLIB_PackageId = <youraccount>/<yourlibrary>
  annotation DAXLIB_PackageVersion = x.x.x
...
```

> **Naming Convention**
> 
> There are some guidelines on DAX UDF naming conventions:
>
> - [DAX Lib Naming Conventions](https://docs.daxlib.org/contribute/naming-conventions)
> - [SQLBI DAX Naming Conventions](https://docs.sqlbi.com/dax-style/dax-naming-conventions)

> **Annotations**
> 
> TDML script must *not* have `CreateOrReplace` keyword
>
> Functions must have the following annotations:
> 
> ```tmdl
> annotation DAXLIB_PackageId = <youraccount>/<yourlibrary>
> annotation DAXLIB_PackageVersion = x.x.x
> ```
>

### icon.png

*Optional:* icon for library

> The icon file must be in PNG format (.PNG), with a maximum size of 100 KB

### README.md
    
*Optional:* Markdown docs file, with general information about the library, usage instructions, examples, and any notes for users

> The file must be in Markdown format (.MD), with a maximum size of 100 KB
>
> For security reasons, only a limited set of Markdown features are supported, and external links may be restricted to trusted domains

## Submitting Library to DAX Lib

Create a pull request from your fork (`<youraccount>/daxlib`) to `daxlib/daxlib` to publish the library on [daxlib.org](https://daxlib.org/)

- Go [here](https://github.com/daxlib/daxlib/pull/new) to create a new pull request from your forked repository to the official DAX Lib repository
- The pull request must be approved manually by DAX Lib owners/maintainers
- After approval your library will appear on [DAX Lib](https://daxlib.org/) for other to download and use

> **Packages are immutable**
>
> After a pull request has been accepted, Packages are immutable. If you want to submit any changes to functions or files, a new version (i.e. v0.1.0 à v0.2.0 ) must be created, and function annotations and `manifest.daxlib` must be updated with the new version number. Changes can then be submitted with a new pull request.
