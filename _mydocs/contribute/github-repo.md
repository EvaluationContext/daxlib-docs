You don’t have to create a repository for your DAX library on daxlib.org, but it’s a smart move if you expect the library to grow. A GitHub repo helps you track issues, accept contributions, and manage changes easily.

To create a GitHub repository for your DAX library, ensure you have a GitHub account; if not, create one. Then, follow the instructions at [https://github.com/daxlib/lib-quickstart-template](https://github.com/daxlib/lib-quickstart-template)
