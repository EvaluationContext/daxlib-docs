Depending on the size and complexity of your DAX library, you can choose one of the following methods to contribute it to DAX Lib:
1. For small libraries (a few functions), follow the [Contribute Small Libraries to DAX Lib](fork-daxlib.md) guide.
2. For medium to large libraries (more functions, more complex logic), consider creating a dedicated GitHub repository by following the [Contribute Medium-Large Libraries to DAX Lib](github-repo.md) guide.
3. If you want to contribute to one DaxLib prefixed library that is maintained by the DaxLib organization, follow the [Contribute to DAX Lib open-source libraries](daxlib-libraries.md) guide.
