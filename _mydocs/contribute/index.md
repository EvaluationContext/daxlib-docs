A DAX library is a collection of DAX user-defined functions (UDFs) written in TMDL format, along with metadata such as the library name, version, and author. It can also include optional files like a README or an icon. Users can contribute by submitting a pull request (PR). Once approved, the library is automatically packaged as a ZIP file and published on daxlib.org, making it available for browsing, installation, and use.

Depending on your DAX library's size and complexity, you can choose one of the following methods to contribute it to DAX Lib:

1. For small libraries (a few functions), follow the [Contribute Small Libraries to DAX Lib](fork-daxlib.md) guide.
2. For medium to large libraries (more functions, more complex logic), consider creating a dedicated GitHub repository by following the [Contribute Medium-Large Libraries to DAX Lib](github-repo.md) guide.
3. If you want to contribute to one DAX Lib official library that is maintained by the DAX Lib organization, follow the [Contribute to DAX Lib official libraries](daxlib-libraries.md) guide.
